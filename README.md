An Email service that uses two proiders; a main one and a backup in case that fails

track: backend

reason: I chose to work with the email service because it's a practical application that can be used daily. I enjoy writing backend code and could use this in the future. I have 2 years of PHP daily experience where I am working with PHP code, our API's, Javacscript, CSS, and HTML. I also have an additional year of experience in PHP while I was getting ramped up on the companies API's while I was in QA (training / spring training). I used PHP for my previous iterations of my website. While at Air Products and Chemicals, I implemented internal tools applications that also considered user permissions for HR and another internal organization with Cold Fusion and ASP. This is something I picked up on the job with books, self-education, and trial and errorq
